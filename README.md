# scRNA_seq
Transcription at gene pairs in the convergent direction could cause RNAPII collision 
since RNA polymerase complex from both DNA strands are challenging to bypass, according to in vitro experiments in Yeast(Hobson et al., 2012).
However, from NET-seq, we know antisense transcription is pervasive across both Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic genomes(Mellor et al., 2016). 
We ask if RNAPII collision occurs in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana.
In our group, we combine bioinformatics analysis and smFISH methodology to investigate how transcription is coordinated at a single locus level in vivo
and whether there is a common mechanism to avoid RNAPII collision.
In addition to many other genome-wide analyses, we are curious about how gene pairsâ€™ expression pattern is in different individual cells or cell types.
This will include analyzing multiple published scRNA-seq in different tissues
